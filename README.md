# Discourse-Coherence-Reference-Grounding-and-Goal-Oriented-Dialogue
Prior approaches to realizing mixed-initiative humanâ€“computer referential communication have adopted information-state or collaborative problem-solving approaches. In this paper, we argue for a new approach, inspired by coherence-based models of discourse such as SDRT (Asher and Lascarides, 2003), in which utterances attach to an evolving discourse structure and the associated knowledge graph of speaker commitments serves as an interface to real-world reasoning and conversational strategy. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation and results from simulation and corpus-based evaluations to demonstrate the flexibility, power, and engineering leverage of our architecture.
